Virtual Wardrobe

SOLO PROJECT BRIEF
Virtual Wardrobe

1. Identify your user(s)

Anyone who has a wardrobe. Particularly, people with a lot of clothes but small living space, making it difficult for them to see all their clothes at once.

2. What is the problem you're solving?

Many people own a lot of clothes but don’t wear them simply due to them being out of sight. A virtual wardrobe lets them to see all their clothes in one space. This lets them do a few things easier: 
  - They can create/visualize outfits with more ease
  - They can identify items they don’t wear or wear very often
  - They can identify which types of items they’re lacking and which items they have many copies of
  - They can plan for trips more efficiently

3. What is the solution?

A virtual wardrobe with categorized “drawers” for different items of clothing. The basic categories would be: 
  - Headwear
  - Tops
  - Outerwear
  - Pants/Shorts
  - Shoes
  - Accessories
More categories (socks, etc…) could be added. Ideally, there will be a selector that allows you to pick certain articles from each category, populating the selected article into a vertical model from headwear → shoes, allowing for easier visualization


4. What is the MVP scope? (core features you must get working)

  1. User login
  2. Allow users to upload clothing items to DB with categories
  3. Allow user to view their clothes from DB in categories
  4. Allow user to delete their clothes from DB


5. What are the tough technical problems involved with solving this problem?

Uploading images to DB may be difficult. A possible solution could be using URLs and another website that allows for image storage. 
Another difficult part may be the outfit creation process - having users click input populate the model. 


6. What are the stretch goals?

  - Making a packing-for-travel functionality that lets the user create multiple outfits
  - Making multiple themes for the virtual wardrobe
  - Making an “outfit randomizer” that creates a random outfit from all the clothes in your closet
